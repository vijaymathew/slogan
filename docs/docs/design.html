    <p>Slogan is a dynamically typed, multi-paradigm programming language with very high-level support for concurrency and parallelism.
      It is a practical language that is easy to learn and play well with the rest of the world.</p>

    <p><h4>Dynamic typing</h4></p>
    <p>Slogan is a dynamically and strongly typed language. This means Slogan has strict type rules that are enforced at runtime.
      Dynamic typing enable programming in the widest possible variety of styles.
      Integration of software components developed and compiled separately, becomes a trivial matter. Dynamic typing makes it easy to turn
      ideas into executable programs at a fast pace. Once developed and tested, a Slogan program can be compiled to efficient machine code
      that runs at full speed on the host platform.</p>

    <p><h4>Multi-paradigm programming</h4></p>
    <p>Designing a clear and concise solution to a problem requires selecting the right paradigm.
      This may be hard or even impossible in languages that prefer one programming style over others. 
      Slogan support many programming styles in a well-factored way. In other words, the different paradigms are not stacked together
      haphazardly. Instead, they are integrated in a simple <em>model</em> of function definition and application. Slogan treat functions as
      first-class entities. Just by mastering this single concept a programmer can write functional or object-based programs.</p>

    <p><h4>Concurrency and parallelism</h4></p>
    <p>Concurrency is generally seen as difficult to get right, thanks to its inherent nondeterministic nature. Slogan's <em>reactive</em>
      variables makes it easy to write declarative concurrent programs. Slogan also support concurrency and parallelism based
      on message passing. More traditional concurrency with shared memory is also possible.</p>

    <p><h4>Practicality</h4></p>
    <p>Slogan has all the facilities for integrating well with the outside world. There are full-featured
      libraries for communicating with other processes running on the same machine or on the same network. The high-level
      Foreign Function Interface makes it possible to call C library functions without special proxy code.
      The interpreter enable fast development and debugging, while the compiler and the packaging system enable
      software to be distributed as a stand-alone executables or as dynamically loadable libraries.</p>

    <p><h5>A note on implementation</h5></p>
    <p>Slogan is implemented in <a href="http://gambitscheme.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Gambit Scheme</a>. Gambit was chosen for its maturity, high-performance, tight integration with the C language and strong support for concurrency.</p>
