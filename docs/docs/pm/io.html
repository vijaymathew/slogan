    <div class="title"><h3>Input and Output</h3></div>
    <p>All input and output operations are performed through objects called <em>streams</em>. A stream is a pointer into a (possibly infinite) stream of data (often a file), 
      an opening through which programs may draw bytes or characters from the stream or place bytes or characters into the stream. 
      A stream may be an input stream, an output stream, or both simultaneously.</p>

    <p>There are initially three streams: the current input stream, current output stream, and current error stream, which are textual streams 
      connected to the process's standard input, standard output, and standard error streams. Several ways to open new streams are provided.</p>

    <p>If one of the input operations is asked to read from a stream that has reached the end of a finite stream, it returns the <code>eof</code> (end-of-file) object. The predicate <code>is_eof_object</code> may be used to determine if the value returned 
      from the input operation is the eof object.</p>

    <p>Streams are either binary or textual. A binary stream allows a program to read or write 8-bit unsigned bytes, or "octets," from or 
      to the underlying stream. A textual stream allows a program to read or write characters.</p>

    <p>A stream may be buffered for efficiency, to eliminate the overhead of a call into the operating system for each byte or character. 
      Three standard buffer modes are supported: <code>block</code>, <code>line</code>, and <code>none</code>. With block buffering, 
      input is drawn from a stream and output is sent to the stream in chunks of some implementation-dependent size. With line buffering, 
      buffering is performed on a line-by-line basis or on some other implementation-dependent basis. Line buffering is typically distinguished 
      from block buffering only for textual output streams; there are no line divisions in binary streams, and input is likely to be drawn from a 
      stream as it becomes available. With buffer-mode <code>none</code>, no buffering is performed, so output is sent immediately to 
      the stream and input is drawn only as needed.</p>

    <p>The remainder of this chapter cover operations on <a href="#transc">transcoders</a>, <a href="#fstreams">file streams</a>,
      <a href="#stdstreams">standard streams</a> and streams on <a href="#sbstreams">strings</a>, <a href="#sbstreams">bytearrays</a>,
      <a href="#proc">processes</a> and the <a href="#net">network</a>. We will also discuss <a href="#generic">generic stream functions</a>
      and <a href="#tokens">functions</a> that specialize on splitting up input streams into <a href="#tokens">tokens</a>.</p>

    <a name="transc"></a>
    <h4>Transcoders</h4>
    <p>In many cases, the underlying stream is organized as a sequence of bytes, but these bytes may have to be treated as encodings for characters. 
      In this case, a textual stream may be created with a transcoder to decode bytes to characters (for input) or encode characters to 
      bytes (for output). A transcoder encapsulates a codec that determine how characters are represented as bytes. </p>


<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>transcoder(codec, @optional eol_style = 'crlf, error_handling_mode = 'ignore)
<b>returns: </b>a transcoder encapsulating `codec`, `eol_style`, and `error_handling_mode`.

`codec` must be one of the following symbols: 'iso_8859_1, 'ascii, 'utf_8,
'utf_16, 'utf_16le, 'utf_16be, 'ucs_2, 'ucs_2le, 'ucs_2be, 'ucs_4, 'ucs_4le, 'ucs_4be.

`eol_style` determines how line endings are recognized. Supported eol styles are:

'lf: line-feed character.
'cr: carriage-return character.
'crlf: carriage return followed by line feed.
'none: no line endings are recognized.

In addition to the codec and eol style, a transcoder encapsulates just one other
piece of information: an error-handling mode that determine what happens if a decoding
or encoding error occurs, i.e., if a sequence of bytes cannot be converted to a character
with the encapsulated codec in the input direction or a character cannot be converted to
a sequence of bytes with the encapsulated codec in the output direction. The error-handling
mode should be one of 'ignore, 'raise and 'replace.
If the error-handling mode is 'ignore, the offending sequence of bytes or the
character is ignored. If the error-handling mode is 'raise, an exception with condition
type i/o-decoding or i/o-encoding is raised; in the input direction, the stream is positioned
beyond the sequence of bytes. If the error-handling mode is 'replace, a replacement
character or character encoding is produced. In the input direction the replacement character
is `U+FFFD`, while in the output direction the replacement is either the encoding of
`U+FFFD` for unicode codecs or the encoding of the question-mark character ( ? )
for other codecs.</code></pre>

<h4>File Streams</h4>
<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>file_reader(path, @key options, buffer_mode, transcoder)
<b>returns: </b>a new input stream for the file named by `path`.
      
If present, `options` must be a list of symbols that control aspects of file operations.
The only option that is valid is 'truncate which means that the file will be truncated
when it is opened.

`buffer_mode` is a symbol that controls buffering. Valid values are 'block, 'line and 'none.
By default, buffering is turned off.

If `transcoder` is specified, it must be a transcoder object and file_reader will return a
textual input stream that will be decoded with `transcoder`. Otherwise, a binary input stream
is returned.</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>file_writer(path, @key options, buffer_mode, transcoder, permissions = 0o666)
<b>returns: </b>a new output stream for the file named by `path`.

If present, `options` must be a list of symbols that control aspects of file operations.
The options that are valid are 'create, 'no_create, 'maybe_create, 'append and 'truncate.

The 'create option requires that the file does not exist (otherwise an exception is raised) and
creates the file when it is opened.
The 'no_create option requires that the file exist (otherwise an exception is raised).
The 'maybe_create option will create the file if it does not exist. This is the default option.
The 'append option controls whether output will be added to the end of the file.
This is useful for writing to log files that might be open by more than one process.
By default appending is turned-off.
The 'truncate option controls whether the file will be truncated when it is opened.
This option is turned-on by default when no 'append option is provided and turned-off
when 'append is not provided.

`buffer_mode` is a symbol that controls buffering. Valid values are 'block, 'line and 'none.
By default, buffering is turned off.

If `transcoder` is present and not false, it must be a transcoder object and file_writer
will return a textual output stream that will be encoded using `transcoder`.
Otherwise, a binary output stream is returned.

`permissions` control the UNIX permissions that will be attached to the file if it is created.

<h4>Process Streams</h4>
<p>The functions described in this section start a new operating system process and create a bidirectional stream for
  communication with that process on its standard input and standard output. </p>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>pipe_reader(path, arguments = [], environment, directory, stdin_redirection = true,
                      stdout_redirection = true, stderr_redirection, pseudo_terminal,

                      show_console = true, transcoder)      
<b>returns: </b>a stream that can be used to communicate with an operating system process.

`path` indicates the location of the executable program in the filesystem.

`direction` should be one of the symbols 'input_output, 'input or 'output.
Defaults to 'input_output.

`arguments` a list of strings. Indicates the string arguments that are passed to the program.
The default value of this setting is the empty list (i.e. no arguments).

`environment` should be a list of strings. Indicates the set of environment variable bindings
that the process receives. Each element of the list is a string of the form "VAR=VALUE",
where VAR is the name of the variable and VALUE is its binding. When environment is false,
the process inherits the environment variable bindings of its parent process.
The default value of this setting is false.

`directory` indicates the current working directory of the process. When directory is false,
the process uses the value of `current_directory()`. The default value of this setting is false.

`stdin_redirection` should be either true or false. Indicates how the standard input of the
process is redirected. A setting of true will redirect the standard input from the process-stream
(i.e. what is written to the process-stream will be available on the standard input).
A setting of false will leave the standard input as-is, which typically results in input coming
from the console. The default value of this setting is true.

`stdout_redirection` should be either true or false. Indicates how the standard output of
the process is redirected. A setting of true will redirect the standard output to the
process-stream (i.e. all output to standard output can be read from the process-stream).
A setting of false will leave the standard output as-is, which typically results in the
output going to the console. The default value of this setting is true.

`stderr_redirection` should be either true or false. Indicates how the standard error of
the process is redirected. A setting of true will redirect the standard error to the
process-stream (i.e. all output to standard error can be read from the process-stream).
A setting of false will leave the standard error as-is, which typically results in error
messages being output to the console. The default value of this setting is false.

`pseudo_terminal` should be either true or false. This setting applies to UNIX. It indicates
what type of device will be bound to the process' standard input and standard output.
A setting of true will use a pseudo-terminal device (this is a device that behaves like
a tty device even though there is no real terminal or user directly involved). A setting of
false will use a pair of pipes. The difference is important for programs which behave
differently when they are used interactively, for example shells. The default value of
this setting is false.

`show_console` should be either true or false. It controls whether the process'
console window will be hidden or visible. The default value of this setting is true
(i.e. show the console window).

`transcoder`, if present, must be a transcoder object, and this function returns a
textual stream whose transcoder is `transcoder`.</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>pipe_process_pid(s)
<b>returns: </b>the ID of the process attached to the process stream `s`.</code></pre>

<h4>TCP Streams</h4>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>tcp_server_stream(address, @key port_number, backlog = 128,
                            reuse_address = true, transcoder)
<b>returns: </b>a tcp-server-stream from which network connections to clients are obtained.

`address` indicates the internet address of the network interface on which connections
requests are accepted, and possibly the IP port number. A string of the form "INTF:PORT"
will be parsed and the value of `INTF` will be assigned to address and the integer value of
`PORT` will be assigned to port_number. This argument can also be a 4 element u8 array which
contain the 32-bit IPv4 address or an 8 element u8 array which contain the 128-bit IPv6 address.

`port_number` must be an exact integer. Indicates the IP port number assigned to the socket which
accepts connection requests from clients.

`backlog` must be a positive-exact-integer. Indicates the maximum number of connection requests
that can be waiting to be accepted by a call to read (technically it is the value passed as the
second argument of the UNIX listen() function). The default value of this setting is 128.

`reuse_address` should be either true or false. Controls whether it is possible to assign a
port number that is currently active. Note that when a server process terminates, the socket
it was using to accept connection requests does not become inactive immediately.
Instead it remains active for a few minutes to ensure clean termination of the connections.
A setting of false will cause an exception to be raised in that case. A setting of true
will allow a port number to be used even if it is active. The default value of
this setting is true.

`transcoder`, if present, must be a transcoder object, and this function returns a
textual stream whose transcoder is `transcoder`.</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>tcp_client_stream(address, @key port_number, keep_alive, coalesce = true, transcoder)
<b>returns:</b> a tcp-client-stream that represent a connection to a TCP server and allows
communication with that server.

`address` indicates the internet address of the server, and possibly the IP port number.
A string of the form "INTF:PORT" will be parsed and the value of `INTF` will be assigned
to address and the integer value of `PORT` will be assigned to port_number.
This argument can also be a 4 element u8 array which contains the 32-bit IPv4 address or
an 8 element u8 array which contains the 128-bit IPv6 address.

`port_number` must be an exact integer. Indicates the IP port number of the server to connect.

`keep_alive` should be either true or false. Controls the use of the "keep alive" option
on the connection. The "keep alive" option will periodically send control packets on
otherwise idle network connections to ensure that the server host is active and reachable.
The default value of this setting is false.

`coalesce` should be either true or false. Controls the use of TCP's "Nagle algorithm"
which reduces the number of small packets by delaying their transmission and coalescing
them into larger packets. A setting of true will coalesce small packets into larger ones.
A setting of false will transmit packets as soon as possible.
The default value of this setting is true. Note that this setting does not
affect the buffering of the stream.
`transcoder`, if present, must be a transcoder object, and this function returns a
textual stream whose transcoder is `transcoder`.</code></pre>

<h4>Stream Operations</h4>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>is_stream(obj)
<b>function: </b>is_writer(obj)
<b>function: </b>is_reader(obj)
<b>returns: </b>true if `obj` is a stream, false otherwise.</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>close_stream(s)
<b>function: </b>close_writer(s)
<b>function: </b>close_reader(s)
returns: void

If the stream `s` is not already closed, these functions closes it, first flushing
any buffered bytes or characters to the underlying stream if the stream is an output stream.
Once a stream is closed, no more input or output operations may be performed on it.
Because the operating system may place limits on the number of file streams open at one time
or restrict access to an open file, it is good practice to close any file stream that will
no longer be used for input or output.
Closing a stream that has already been closed has no effect.

Closing a string or byte array stream has no effect. As they consume no system resources, string
and byte array streams can be safely reclaimed by the garbage collector.</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>stream_position(stream)
<b>returns: </b>the stream's current position.

A stream may allow queries to determine its current position in the underlying
stream of bytes or characters. If so, stream_position returns the current position.
For binary streams, the position is always an exact nonnegative integer byte displacement
from the start of the byte stream. For textual streams, the representation of a position
is unspecified; it may not be an exact nonnegative integer and, even if it is, it may not
represent either a byte or character displacement in the underlying stream.
If stream_position is called on a stream that does not support it, an exception is raised.</code></pre>
</div>


<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>stream_has_position(stream)
<b>returns: </b>true if `stream` allows querying position, false otherwise.</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>set_stream_position(stream, pos, @optional whence = 'beginning)
<b>returns: </b>the new position on success.
      
A stream may allow its current position to be moved directly to a different position
in the underlying stream of bytes or characters. If so, set_stream_position changes the
current position to `pos`. For binary streams, the position `pos` must be an exact
nonnegative integer byte displacement from the start of the byte stream.
For textual streams, the representation of a position is unspecified, but `pos` must
be an appropriate position for the textual stream. If set_stream_position is called on a
stream that does not support it, an exception is raised.

The symbolic argument `whence` should be one of: 'beginning, 'current or 'end. When `whence` is
omitted or is 'beginning, the position is relative to the beginning of the file. When `whence` is 'current,
`pos` is taken to be relative to the current byte position of the file.
When whence is `end`, `pos` is taken to be relative to the end of the file.

If `stream` is a binary output stream and the position is set beyond the current end
of the data in the underlying stream, `stream` is not extended until new data is written
at that position. If new data is written at that position, the contents of each
intervening position is unspecified. Binary streams created with file_writer and file_reader
can always be extended in this manner within the limits of the underlying operating system.
In other cases, attempts to set the stream beyond the current end of data in the underlying
object may result in an exception.</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code><b>function: </b>call_with_stream(stream, f)
<b>returns: </b>the value returned by the function `f`.

`call_with_stream` calls the `f` with `stream` as its only argument. If `f` returns,
call_with_stream closes `stream` and returns the value returned by `f`. If `f` raise an exception,
call_with_stream closes `stream` and re-throws the exception.

`call_with_stream` does not automatically close `stream` if a continuation created outside of `f`
is invoked, since it is possible that another continuation created inside of `f` will be invoked
at a later time, returning control to `f`.

<span class="c">// Example:</span>
call_with_stream(file_writer("abc"), ^(s) println(stream = s, "hello, world"));

Set timeouts on read and write operations.
Both `reader` and `writer` are streams. `timeout` is a real number indicating
the number of seconds to wait. The optional argument `f`, if specified, must be a function
that takes no arguments and will be called on the timeout event. If this call return false, t
he IO operation is abandoned and the end-of-file object is returned for readers and an
exception will be raised for writers. Otherwise the IO operation will be attempted again.
Note that if the stream's timeout value has not changed the `f` will be called again immediately.
`f` defaults to a function that always return false.</code></pre>

<h4>Bit streams</h4>
<p>Bit streams are for reading and writing data at bit-level. As a simple example of bit encoded data,
  consider 16-bit color values. In 16-bit color, the red and blue components are encoded using 5-bits each,
  while the green component takes up 6-bit. The following program reads and writes 16-bit encoded color
  values: </p>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code>function encode_color(rgb)
