    <h1 class="title">Getting Started</h1>

    <h2>2.1 Installation</h2>

    <p>Slogan is distributed in source code form. <a href="https://github.com/vijaymathew/slogan/releases" target="_blank">Download</a>
      the latest release package and extract it. <a name="01-back"></a>Releases are available as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)" target="_blank">.zip</a> and
      <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-bsd-extract-targz-file" target="_blank">.tar.gz</a> archives.<sup><a href="#01">1</a></sup>
      <a name="02-back"></a>In the extracted folder, run the install command:<sup><a href="#02">2</a></sup></p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
$ sudo ./install
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The installation process should run smoothly on all modern operating systems in the UNIX family, like OS X, GNU Linux and the various BSDs.</p>
    
    <p>The best way to experiment with Slogan is through the REPL (the <em>read-eval-print loop</em>).
      The REPL is the primary interface to the Slogan interpreter. You can launch the REPL by typing the command,</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
$ slogan
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>This should land you in the REPL with the prompt shown below:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>slogan&gt;</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p><a name="03-back"></a>Now the Slogan interpreter<sup><a href="#03">3</a></sup> is waiting for some input.
      Let us try typing <code>1 + 2;</code> followed by the enter key. <a name="04-back"></a>Slogan will respond back with the result:
      <sup><a href="#04">4</a></sup></p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
slogan&gt; 1 + 2;
<span class="comment">// 3</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    
    <h2>2.2 Saying Hello</h2>

    <p>Next we will write a small program to read the name of the user and print back a greeting. You may want to type this program into
      a file and load it into the interpreter. I decided to type this program into a file named <code>hello.sn</code>.
      (By convention, Slogan source files have the <code>.sn</code> extension). <a name="05-back"></a>
      The following code listing shows the complete program:<sup><a href="#05">5</a></sup></p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<a href="ref/showln.html">showln</a>(<span class="str">"Hello "</span>, <a href="ref/read_line.html">read_line</a>())
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The program consists of calls to two built-in functions - <code>showln</code> and <code>read_line</code>.
      <code>Showln</code> accepts an
      arbitrary number of arguments and prints them to the standard output. <code>Read_line</code> reads one line of characters from the
      standard input. To test the program, let us load the script into the REPL:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
slogan&gt; <a href="ref/load.html">load</a>(<span class="str">"hello"</span>);
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>You should see the REPL waiting for you to input something. Type a name, like "Nemo", and press enter. You should see
      the following output:</p>

    <div class="prog">
        <pre><code>Hello Nemo</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Slogan is a compiled language. You can translate the "hello" program into instructions of the underlying hardware.
      <a name="06-back"></a>This compilation can be done from the REPL itself, by calling the <a href="ref/compile.html"><code>compile</code></a>
      function as shown below:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
compile(<span class="str">"hello"</span>, exe = <span class="pw">true</span>);
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>A binary file named "hello" will be produced. This is a stand-alone executable and can be distributed to run on other similar systems.
      You may want to test the binary once by invoking it directly from the command line:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
$ ./hello
Vijay
<span class="comment">//&gt; Hello Vijay</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2><a name="timeserver"></a>2.2 A Network Time Server and Client</h2>
    
    <p>In this section we examine how Slogan programs can communicate with each other over a network.</p>
    
    <p>The first program we write is a server, a program that responds to requests that it receive over the network. When the program runs,
      it will start listening on port number <code>2121</code> for incoming requests. A valid request is the message <code>GET TIME</code>.
      The server will return the current time as response. All other requests are considered invalid and an error message is returned.</p>

    <p>The following code listing shows the first version of our "time server". A description of what each line in the program does is given
      as comments in the code itself. (A line that starts with two slash characters (<code>&#47;&#47;</code>) is treated as a comment. Multi-line
      comments are enclosed in a <code>&#47;&#42;</code> and a <code>&#42;&#47;</code>. Comments are ignored by the interpreter and the compiler).</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="comment">// file: <a href="./code/time_server.sn">time_server.sn</a>

// Start the server and listen for connections on port 2121</span>
<span class="kw">let</span> server = tcp_server_stream(2121)
            
<span class="comment">// Accept the first client connection</span>
<span class="kw">let</span> client = read(server)

<span class="comment">/* Read request from client, if it is valid
  return the current time on server,
  otherwise return an error message */</span>  
<span class="kw">let</span> request = read_line(client)    
<span class="kw">if</span> (request == <span class="str">"GET TIME"</span>)
  showln(stream = client, time_to_string(now()))
<span class="kw">else</span>
  showln(stream = client, <span class="str">"error: invalid request"</span>)

<span class="comment">// Release the system resources used by both streams</span>
close_stream(client)
close_stream(server)
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>To test the server, we need a client to talk in our time protocol. Let us write the client next:</p>

    <div class="prog">
        <pre><code>
<span class="comment">// file: <a href="./code/time_client.sn">time_client.sn</a>

// Connect to the time server, running on the same machine</span>
<span class="kw">let</span> client = tcp_client_stream(<span class="str">"localhost"</span>, port_number = 2121)
showln(stream = client, <span class="str">"GET TIME"</span>)
flush_writer(client)
showln(read_line(client))
close_stream(client)
        </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p><a name="07-back"></a>Now we are all set to test the server-client pair. Make sure you have two instances of the Slogan REPL running.
      Load<sup><a href="#07">7</a></sup> the server into the first REPL:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
slogan&gt; load(<span class="str">"time_server"</span>);
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Next, load the client into the second REPL. You should see the client printing the current time it received from the server.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
slogan&gt; load(<span class="str">"time_client"</span>);
<span class="comment">//&gt; 2017-04-24T22:46:47</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The time server, though it works, clearly has some limitations. First of all, it can handle only one client. It has to be restarted
      to handle the next one! We need to change the code in such a way that the server once invoked will go on to process all clients that wish
      to talk to it. It should also respond to each client as fast as possible. That means handling one client should not block or delay the
      response to other clients. The server should also become more robust. For instance, what will happen if the client tries to connect to a
      server that is not up and running? Right now, the client will display an error message and crash.
      In the following chapters we will learn about features offered by Slogan to help us fix all these problems. So, stay along!</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p><sup><a name="03"></a><a href="#03-back">3</a></sup>Having an interpreter greatly influences the way programs are designed and developed.
        You can quickly experiment with ideas in the REPL and get immediate feedback. Once you have ironed-out an idea, it can
        make into the final program which is compiled to machine code.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p><sup><a name="04"></a><a href="#04-back">4</a></sup>In the code examples, the value of an expression will be shown as a simple comment
        right after the expression. The commenting convention <code>//&gt;</code> is used to mark output produced by a side-effecting
        operation, like printing a value to the standard output stream.</p>
