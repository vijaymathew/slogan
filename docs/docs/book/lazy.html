    <h1 class="title">A Tryst With Infinity</h1>

    <p>In <a href="state.html">Chapter 7</a> on State and Modularity, we learned how to use assignment as a tool for modeling the real world.
      In the <a href="conc.html">preceding chapter</a> we came face-to-face with some of the complications that assignment can raise if
      used along with concurrency. The root cause of the problem is that a variation in the object being modeled will lead to a state variation in
      the program as well. Along with the problems of
      concurrent assignments, objects with varying state has another drawback &ndash; they are ignorant of their own history. In other words, once
      a state change has occurred, it is not possible to figure out how the object looked at a point in time in the past.</p>

    <p>In this chapter we will explore another way to model change without assignments. The idea, at an abstract level, is to represent the varying
      object as a function <em>f(x, t)</em>, which return the state of the object <code>x</code> at time <code>t</code>. This function can be implemented
      using an association list or a hash table which maps a time to the state of <code>x</code> at that time. This will work as long as we don't
      want the state at an arbitrary time in the future or in the past. But for this abstraction to be useful, we should be able to represent very large
      or even <em>infinite</em> sequences of states. Slogan realizes this idea in the form of <em>lazy sequences</em>.</p>

    <p>Before looking at how lazy sequences help us model systems with state without ever using assignment, we should get familiar with the programming
      technique that make these sequences possible. This technique is known as <em>lazy</em> or <em>delayed evaluation</em>.</p>

    <h2>9.1 Delayed Evaluation</h2>

    <p>If we are allowed to package an expression in such a way that it can be evaluated later on demand, we have delayed evaluation in our language.
      In fact you already know how to do delayed evaluations! When we package an expression as a function, we are effectively delaying the evaluation
      of that expression until the function is called. For example, if we want an expensive computation to be evaluated only when its value is
      actually needed by the program, we package the expression into a function. We call that function at the point in the program where the value
      needs to be computed and used.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> expensive_computation = <span class="kw">^</span>() { <a href="ref/showln.html">showln</a>(<span class="str">"performing long computation..."</span>)
                                  <a href="ref/task_sleep.html">task_sleep</a>(2)
                                  12345 }

expensive_computation()
<span class="comment">//&gt; performing long computation...
// 12345</span>
expensive_computation()
<span class="comment">//&gt; performing long computation...
// 12345</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The problem with the <code>expensive_computation</code> function is that each time it is called, the whole computation is repeated again.
      A better version of the function will cache the result once computed and return that value when the function is called again.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> expensive_computation = <span class="kw">let</span> (cached_result = <span class="pw">false</span>)
                              <span class="kw">^</span>() <span class="kw">if</span> (cached_result) cached_result
                                  <span class="kw">else</span> { showln(<span class="str">"performing long computation..."</span>)
                                         task_sleep(2)
                                         cached_result = 12345
                                         cached_result }

      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>This optimization is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization" target="_blank">memoization</a>. Slogan provides
      the <em>delay</em> operator (<code><span class="pw">~</span></code>) for expressing memoized functions easily.
      Any expression can be delayed by prefixing it
      with the delay operator. The delay operator's return value is an object called the <em>promise</em> which can be <em>forced</em>
      to evaluate and return the expression's value. This value is cached by the promise object and returned when it is forced again.</p>

    <p>We can rewrite the <code>expensive_computation</code> function using delay as shown below:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> expensive_computation = <span class="pw">~</span>{ showln(<span class="str">"performing long computation..."</span>)
                               task_sleep(2)
                               12345 }

<span class="comment">// 12345</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2>9.2 Lazy Sequences</h2>

    <p>With that introduction to delayed expressions, we are in a position to understand sequences that can conceptually extend to infinity.
      The fundamental data structure that can be used to represent a sequence of values is the <a href="ref/list.html">list</a>.
      As we saw <a href="cdt.html">earlier</a> in this book, a list is just a <a href="ref/pair.html">pair</a> of pairs that is terminated by
      an <a href="ref/is_empty.html">empty list</a>. To make this clear, look at the following definitions of two lists with similar layouts:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
<span class="kw">let</span> ys = 1:2:3:4:5:[]

ys
<span class="comment">// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</span>
xs == ys
<span class="comment">// true</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The problem with lists created from pairs is that they have to eventually terminate. What if we need a list from which we can fetch values
      to our soul's content? This can be achieved by making a pair whose <a href="ref/head.html">head</a> is the first value in the sequence and
      whose <a href="ref/tail.html">tail</a> is a <em>promise</em> to generate the next value when required. This idea is expressed in the
      function below, which represents an infinite sequence of integers:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> infinite_integers(i)
  i:<span class="pw">~</span>infinite_integers(i+1)
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p><code>Infinite_integers</code> calls itself recursively to generate the next value in the sequence, but that call is delayed until the next value is
      actually needed. So calling the function will not go into an infinite loop.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> xs = infinite_integers(1)
xs
<span class="comment">// [1, ...]</span>
head(xs)
<span class="comment">// 1</span>
head(force(tail(xs)))
<span class="comment">// 2</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>To have to explicitly force each element in the sequence can be a bit awkward. The functions <code><a href="ref/first.html">first</a></code>,
      <code><a href="ref/rest.html">rest</a></code> and <code><a href="ref/nth.html">nth</a></code> know how to access elements in a sequence,
      invoking <code>force</code> at the right places.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
first(xs)
<span class="comment">// 1</span>
first(rest(xs))
<span class="comment">// 2</span>
nth(0, xs)
<span class="comment">// 1</span>
nth(10, xs)
<span class="comment">// 11</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>9.2.1 Generic Operations on Sequences</h3>

    <p>In Slogan, list is the default data structure for representing and manipulating a sequence of values. When coupled with
      higher-order functions like <code><a href="ref/map.html">map</a></code>, <code><a href="ref/fold.html">fold</a></code> and
      <code><a href="ref/filter.html">filter</a></code>, 
      programs that manipulate lists can lead to elegant solutions to many data transformation problems. To illustrate this, consider
      a program for computing the sum of all prime numbers in an interval. As a first attempt, let us define the program in an iterative style:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> sum_primes(a, b)
  <span class="kw">letfn</span> loop (count = a, accum = 0)
    <span class="kw">if</span> (count > b) accum
    <span class="kw">else if</span> (<a href="ref/is_prime.html">is_prime</a>(count)) loop(inc(count), count + accum)
    <span class="kw">else</span> loop(inc(count), accum)

<span class="comment">// usage example:</span>
sum_primes(1, 20)
<span class="comment">// 77</span>
sum_primes(10000, 1000000)
<span class="comment">// 37544665627</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>We can define this function in a more declarative style by using the higher-order functions we saw in <a href="func.html">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> sum_primes(a, b)
  fold(`<a href="ref/add.html">+</a>`, 0, filter(is_prime, <a href="ref/range.html">range</a>(a, b)))          
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Though the second <code>sum_primes</code> is shorter and sweeter than the first, it is grossly inefficient when it comes to memory consumption.
      <code>Filter</code> cannot do any work until <code>range</code> returns a whole list. Then a new list is generated by <code>filter</code> which
      is reduced to a sum by <code>fold</code>.

    <p>The inefficiency in using lists becomes painfully apparent if we use the same paradigm to compute the second prime in a large interval:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> nth_prime(n, a, b)
  <a href="ref/nth.html">nth</a>(n, filter(<a href="ref/is_prime.html">is_prime</a>, range(a, b)))

nth_prime(1, 1, 20)
<span class="comment">// 3</span>
nth_prime(1, 10000, 1000000)
<span class="comment">// 10009</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The function does find the n<sup>th</sup> prime, but the computational overhead is outrageous for calls that search over a large range of
      numbers. For instance, the call <code>nth_prime(10000, 1000000)</code> will construct a list of almost a million integers, filter this
      list by testing each element for primality, and then ignore almost all of the result. If we were programming in the iterative style,
      we would interleave the enumeration and the filtering, and stop when we reached the second prime.</p>

    <p>With lazy sequences we can achieve the best of both worlds: We can formulate programs elegantly as sequence manipulations,
      while attaining the efficiency of incremental computation. There are higher-order functions that can work with lists and lazy sequences
      alike. <code>Filter</code> and <code>map</code> are two examples. When working with lazy sequences, they will construct only that
      part of the sequence that is actually required for the current computation. As the computation makes progress,
      more of the sequence will be realized maintaining an illusion of an infinite stream of values.</p>

    <p>Both the <code>sum_primes</code> and <code>nth_prime</code> functions can be rewritten to take advantage of generic functions that
      takes lazy sequences as arguments. Specifically, we have to replace the call to <code>range</code> with
      <code><a href="ref/enumerate.html">enumerate</a></code> and the call to <code>fold</code> with
      <code><a href="ref/accumulate.html">accumulate</a></code> . While <code>range</code> returns a fully realized list of values,
      <code>enumerate</code> will give us a lazy sequence of the same values. <code>Accumulate</code> knows how to reduce a lazy sequence
      to a single value, incrementally.</p>

    <p>First we will write the <code>sum_primes</code> function using the new sequence functions:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> sum_primes(a, b)
  accumulate(`+`, 0, filter(is_prime, enumerate(a, b)))
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>When we call <code>sum_primes</code> with a large range, it will return immediately with a lazy sequence of sums, deferring the actual
      computation of the sum only when it is explicitly requested by a sequence accessor such as <code><a href="ref/nth.html">nth</a></code>:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> s = sum_primes(10000, 1000000)
nth(10000, s)
<span class="comment">// 628132235</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The performance enhancement we get for the <code>nth_prime</code> function is even more profound.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> nth_prime(n, a, b)
  nth(n, filter(is_prime, enumerate(a, b)))

nth_prime(1, 10000, 1000000) <span class="comment">// this call will return immediately</span>
<span class="comment">// 10009</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>9.2.2 Modularity of Lazy Sequences</h3>

    <p>As we saw in <a href="state.html">Chapter 7</a>, one of the major benefits of introducing assignment is that we can increase the modularity
      of our systems by hiding or <em>encapsulating</em> its state in local variables. Let us revisit this idea with the example of a simple
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator" target="_blank">Pseudo-random Number Generator</a>.
      <a name="01-back"></a>First let us implement a purely functional version of the PRNG that do not make use of local state
      or assignments<sup><a href="#01">1</a></sup>.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> rand(seed)
  rand_update(seed)

<span class="kw">function</span> rand_update(x)
  <span class="kw">let</span> (a = 27, b = 26, m = 127)
    <a href="ref/modulo.html">modulo</a>(a * x + b, m)
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The functional purity of the <code>rand</code> function comes with a cost, users must take care of passing the accurate current state of the
      PRNG to each successive call to the function. This is because its implementation is not modular enough to hide and keep track of its
      internal state.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
rand(10)
<span class="comment">// 42</span>
rand(42)
<span class="comment">// 17</span>
rand(17)
<span class="comment">// 104</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>By bringing assignment to the scene, we will be able to create PRNG <em>objects</em> that can keep track of their own internal state and are
      more modular.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> make_rand(seed)
  <span class="kw">let</span> (x = seed)
    <span class="kw">^</span>() { x = rand_update(x)
          x }

<span class="kw">let</span> r = make_rand(10)
r()
<span class="comment">// 42</span>
r()
<span class="comment">// 17</span>
r()
<span class="comment">// 104</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>If we realize the PRNG using lazy sequences, we will be able to have the benefits of modularity by not incurring the costs
      associated with assignment. With lazy sequences, we will have a stream of random numbers
      produced by successive calls to <code>rand_update</code>.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> rand(seed)
  <span class="kw">let</span> (x = rand_update(seed))
     x:<span class="pw">~</span>rand(x)

<span class="kw">let</span> rs = rand(10)
nth(0, rs)
<span class="comment">// 42</span>
nth(2, rs)
<span class="comment">// 104</span>
nth(99, rs)
<span class="comment">// 20</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>We get considerable modularity with this approach, yet we do not have to maintain a changing local state.</p>

    <h2>9.2 Generators</h2>

    <p>Generators are functions that can behave as if they return an infinite sequence of values. A generator function can be made to <em>return</em>
      a value before its body is fully evaluated. This is accomplished by calling the <code><span class="kw">yield</span></code> expression, which
      returns a pair of the return value and an object known as an <em>iterator</em>. The iterator object knows how to restart the function where
      <code><span class="kw">yield</span></code> was called. If the function is written in such a way that it will return another
      <code>value:iterator</code> pair, the caller effectively gets a sequence of infinite values.</p>

    <p>In the next example, we will write a function that will give us an infinite sequence of random numbers, generated with the help of
      <code><span class="kw">yield</span></code>.</p>
    
    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> rand(seed)
  <span class="kw">letfn</span> loop (x = rand_update(seed))
  { <span class="kw">yield</span> x
    loop(rand_update(x)) }

<span class="kw">let</span> rs = rand(10)
<a href="ref/first.html">first</a>(rs)
<span class="comment">// 42</span>
first(<a href="ref/rest.html">rest</a>(rs))
<span class="comment">// 17</span>
first(rest(rs))
<span class="comment">// 104</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Note that once an iterator is asked to move forward, there is no way to ask it to get a value from the past. Because of this, they may not be a
      stand-in replacement for lazy sequences created by the <code>delay</code> operator. A function that generates an iterator should also not call
      itself recursively. Instead use a named <code><span class="kw">letfn</span></code> as shown in the example.</p>

    <p>By default, <code><span class="kw">yield</span></code> returns <code><a href="ref/void.html">void</a></code>. The <code>next</code> function can
      be called to pass a user-defined value to <code><span class="kw">yield</span></code>, which will become its return value. Please see the reference
      on <code><a href="ref/next.html">next</a></code> for more information.</p>

    <p>The traversal on an iterator can be wrapped into a convenience function. This is achieve by calling the
      <code><a href="ref/iterator.html">iterator</a></code> constructor. This call will return a function that can be called to traverse the iterator.
      Each call to this function will result in returning the next value from the iterator. When all values run out, this function will return
      <code><span class="pw">false</span></code>.

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> iter = iterator(rand(100))

iter()
<span class="comment">// 59</span>
iter()
<span class="comment">// 95</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2>9.3 Custom Sequences</h2>

    <p>As we saw in the previous sections, <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code> are the generic means for accessing many types of sequences.
      Their genericity is not limited to built-in sequences like lists, lazy sequences and generators. You can define your own custom sequence objects
      that can be destructured with these functions. This can is accomplished by defining the object as a closure that responds to the
      <code><span class="sym">'first</span></code> and <code><span class="sym">'rest</span></code> messages.</p>

    <p>In this section we will define a custom sequence that respond to these messages and see how it automatically gets fitted into the larger context
      of the language. The data structure we are going to define is simply called a <em>bag</em>. You create a bag with a collection of objects. These
      objects can be taken out one by one, but there is no guarantee to the order in which they will come out, similar to picking out items from a real
      bag without looking into it.</p>

    <p>The following program defines the <code>bag</code> data structure. The constructor <code>make_bag</code> takes a finite sequence as argument.
      This is sequence is shuffled and stored in a local list. The returned object redirects the <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code> messages to
      this list.</p>
      
    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> make_bag(objects)
  <span class="kw">letfn</span> (objs = shuffle(objects))
    <span class="kw">^</span>(msg)
    | <span class="sym">'first</span> -> first(objs)
    | <span class="sym">'rest</span> -> rest(objs)

<span class="comment">// utility functions for shuffling a sequence.</span>
<span class="kw">function</span> shuffle(objects)

    <span class="kw">if</span> (not(objs)) result
    <span class="kw">else let</span> (len = count(objs))
      <span class="kw">if</span> (len == 0) result
      <span class="kw">else let</span> (i = random_integer(len))

    <span class="kw">else if</span> (i == n) loop(rest(objs), i + 1, result)
    <span class="kw">else</span> loop (rest(objs), i + 1, first(objs):result)
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>This is how you would use the new bag sequence:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> b = make_bag([1,2,3,4,5])
<span class="comment">// the results you get may be different,
// because the list is randomly shuffled by the bag.</span>
first(b)
<span class="comment">// 4</span>
first(rest(b))
<span class="comment">// 3</span>

<span class="comment">// destructuring a bag:</span>
<span class="kw">let</span> [a,b,c,d,e] = b;

<span class="comment">// [4, 3, 1, 2, 5]</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>You can make the bag data structure more versatile by overriding the <code><a href="ref/ref.html">ref</a></code> and
      <code><a href="ref/ref_set.html">ref_set</a></code> messages. See the references for more information.</p>
