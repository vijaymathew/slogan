    <h1 class="title">Advanced Flow Control</h1>

    <p>The basic control flow expressions in Slogan are the <code><span class="kw">if</span></code> and <code><span class="kw">when</span></code>
      conditions. Recursion and the imperative <code><span class="kw">for</span></code> loop construct also enable control
      flow, but they depend on the conditional expressions for their implementation. Conditional expressions are important in another way &ndash;
      they enable the implementation of a basic error handling mechanism. For example, this is how we may implement a (hypothetical)
      function that tries to open a file:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> open_file(file_name)
  <span class="kw">if</span> (<a href="ref/file_exists.html">file_exists</a>(file_name))
    open_and_return_a_handle_to_the_file(file_name)
  <span class="kw">else</span> <span class="pw">false</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The callers of this function should handle a case where the file is missing with an <code><span class="kw">if</span></code> expression:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> (f = open_file(<span class="str">"some_file"</span>))
  <span class="kw">if</span> (f) do_something_to_the_file(f)
  <span class="kw">else</span> <a href="ref/showln.html">showln</a>(<span class="str">"failed to open file"</span>)
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>This is the declarative way to deal with exceptional situations like trying to open a nonexistent file, dividing by zero etc.
      But it is cumbersome and error prone to add checks throughout the program. An elegant alternative is to add an exception-handling
      mechanism to the language. In the first section of this chapter, we will learn about exception-handling in Slogan. Later we will learn
      how to design abstractions that can control program flow in any way imaginable!</p>
    
    <h2>10.1 Exceptions</h2>

    <p>When an expression cannot be evaluated correctly, we often speak of "raising an error". But what should this statement exactly do? It should,
      in a controlled way, transfer execution to another part of the program that knows how to deal with the error, without crashing the running
      program. This part of the program that specializes in dealing with errors is known as the <em>exception handler</em>. While an error is thrown,
      a value describing the error is passed to the exception handler.</p>

    <p>Slogan's exception handling mechanism is designed around the <em>error confinement</em> principal which states that the error in a
      <em>component</em> should be catchable at the component boundary. Outside the component, the error is either invisible or reported in a nice way.
      That means raising an error will cause the program control to "jump" from inside the component to its boundary.
      <a name="01-back"></a>This is a single operation, able to exit from arbitrarily many levels of nested context<a href="#01"><sup>1</sup></a>.

    <p>In Slogan, the function <code><a href="ref/raise.html">raise</a></code> is the basic mechanism for raising exceptions. The
      <code><span class="kw">try</span>-<span class="kw">catch</span></code> expression is used for handling raised exceptions.
      <code><span class="kw">Try</span>-<span class="kw">catch</span></code> has the following general syntax:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">try</span>
  expr
<span class="kw">catch</span> (err)
  handle_err_expr
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The expression <code>expr</code> can raise an error by calling <code>raise()</code> with an arbitrary object as argument. This object
      represents the error condition and is passed as argument to <code><span class="pw">catch</span></code>. The <code>handle_err_expr</code>
      is an expression that should decide what to do about the error object.</p>

    <p>As an example of using exceptions in practice, consider an implementation of
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)" target="_blank">stack data type</a>.
      We can implement a stack on top of an array, the size of which is specified when the stack is created. An attempt to push
      more items than the stack can hold will be blocked by raising an error. Similarly, an attempt to remove an item from an empty stack will also
      raise an error.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> make_stack(size)
  <span class="kw">let</span> (elems = <a href="ref/make_array.html">make_array</a>(size),
       index = 0)
  { <span class="kw">function</span> push(e)
      <span class="kw">if</span> (index >= size)
        raise(<span class="str">"too many elements"</span>)
      <span class="kw">else</span>
      { elems[index] = e
        index = index + 1 }

    <span class="comment">// Return the top element.</span>
    <span class="kw">function</span> top()
      <span class="kw">if</span> (index == 0)
        raise(<span class="str">"empty stack"</span>)
      <span class="kw">else</span> elems[index - 1]

    <span class="comment">// Remove and return the top element.</span>
    <span class="kw">function</span> pop()
      <span class="kw">if</span> (index == 0)
        raise(<span class="str">"empty stack"</span>)
      <span class="kw">else let</span> (e = elems[index - 1])
      { index = index - 1
        e }

    <span class="kw">^</span>(message)
    | <span class="sym">'push</span> -> push
    | <span class="sym">'top</span> -> top
    | <span class="sym">'pop</span> -> pop
    | _ -> raise(<span class="str">"invalid message"</span>) }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Any attempt to violate the invariants on a stack object will be prevented by the raising errors.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> s = make_stack(3)
s.push(10)
s.push(23)
s.top()
<span class="comment">// 23</span>
s.pop()
<span class="comment">// 23</span>
s.pop()
<span class="comment">// 10</span>
s.pop()
<span class="comment">//&gt; error: This object was raised: "empty stack"</span>
        </code><pre>
    </div>

    <p>Using exception handlers, we can contain and deal with such exceptions in a cleaner way. The following function implements a "safer"
      alternative to <code>pop</code> stack. It handles the error by logging it to the console and returning a default value to the caller:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> safe_pop(stack, <span class="pw">@optional</span> default)
  <span class="kw">try</span>
    stack.pop()
  <span class="kw">catch</span> (err)
  { showln(<span class="str">"stack error: "</span>, err)
    default }

safe_pop(s)
<span class="comment">//&gt; stack error: empty stack
// false</span>

safe_pop(s, 10)
<span class="comment">//&gt; stack error: empty stack
// 10</span>

s.push(100)
safe_pop(s)
<span class="comment">// 100</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Code that handles exceptions may not get enough information about the error, if that has been thrown by a call to <code>raise(obj)</code>.
      The argument to <code>raise</code> can be an arbitrary object, it may not even be a string. So the exception handler should know how to
      interpret the error object beforehand to do proper error logging and handling. The function <code><a href="ref/error.html">error</a></code>
      can help make life easier for code that has to process information about errors.</p>

    <p>Instead of raising an arbitrary object, the <code>error</code> function always raises an object of type <code>error-exception</code> record
      which has a message field and a list of "argument" fields which can contain additional information about the error.</p>

    <h3>10.1.1 Performing Cleanup</h3>

    <p>A <code><span class="kw">try</span></code> expression can specify a <code><span class="kw">finally</span></code> clause which is always
      executed, whether or not the expression raises an exception. This is useful when dealing with entities that are managed external to
      the language runtime. With <code><span class="kw">finally</span></code>, we can guarantee that some "cleanup" action gets performed
      on the entity, whether or not an exception occurs. An example of such an external entity is the <em>handle</em> to an open file, which is
      a limited resource managed by the operating system. The program must make sure it returns this handle back to the
      operating system by closing the file handle, even if an exception was raised while using (reading/writing) it.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> f = <span class="pw">false</span>          
<span class="kw">try</span>
{ f = <a href="ref/file_reader.html">file_reader</a>(<span class="str">"abc.txt"</span>)
  <a href="ref/read_all_chars.html">read_all_chars</a>(f) }
<span class="kw">catch</span> (err)
  showln(<span class="str">"failed to read file - "</span>, err)
<span class="kw">finally</span>
  <span class="kw">when</span> (f)
  { showln(<span class="str">"closing file..."</span>)
    <a href="ref/close_reader.html">close_reader</a>(f) }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>If you want the exception to be handled in an outer layer, you can omit the <code><span class="kw">catch</span></code> clause. This will cause the
      exception to be re-raised, after the <code><span class="kw">finally</span></code> clause is executed.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> f = <span class="pw">false</span>          
<span class="kw">try</span>
{ f = file_reader(<span class="str">"abc.txt"</span>)
  read_all_chars(f) }
<span class="kw">finally</span>
  <span class="kw">when</span> (f)
  { showln(<span class="str">"closing file..."</span>)
    close_reader(f) }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Mixing file operations and exception handling leads to lot of boilerplate code. Slogan provide abstractions that let us express
      input/output operations in a concise, declarative style. The <code><a href="ref/call_with_stream.html">call_with_stream</a></code>
      function is one such abstraction.</p>
    
    <h2>10.2 Abstracting Control Flow</h2>

    <p>So far in this book we have discussed quite a few programming constructs that can control how the program flows - the
      <code><span class="kw">if</span></code> and <code><span class="kw">when</span></code> expressions, the
      <code><span class="kw">try</span>-<span class="kw">catch</span></code> expression, the <code><span class="kw">yield</span></code>
      statement, the imperative <code><span class="kw">for</span></code> loop and so on. You might have encountered some or all of these
      in other languages as well. Programming language designers will bake in those control structures they feel are the only ones
      their users will ever need. When programmers talk about a language being "extensible" what they mean is that the language allows
      them to define new data abstractions. Can a language be extensible in the sense that users can add new control structures to the
      language? This is the question we are dealing with in this section.</p>

    <p>A language with higher-order functions can define functions that behave like built-in control structures. For example,
      the following program defines a function that behaves like the <code>while</code> loop found in most imperative programming languages:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> while(cond, body)
  <span class="kw">when</span> (cond())
  { body()
    while(cond, body) }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p><code>While()</code> take two functions as arguments. The first one return <code><span class="pw">true</span></code> as long as a
      particular condition holds. The second function is called if the condition holds and <code>while</code> is called again recursively,
      creating the effect of a loop. Here is how we would use our new looping construct:<p>

      <div class="prog">
        <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> i = 0
while (<span class="kw">^</span>() i < 5,
       <span class="kw">^</span>() { showln(i); i = i + 1 })
<span class="comment">//&gt; 0
    1
    2
    3
    4</span>
        </code></pre>
      </div>

    <p>"Functional" control structures like this one have two immediate problems. First is that, they do not introduce new "syntax" to the language.
      Invoking them are basically just function calls and building their function arguments can be verbose. The construct might be cleaner
      and easier to use if users are allowed to type something like:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
while (i &lt; 5)
{ showln(i)
  i = i + 1 }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The second problem is that a function is not allowed to return to and execute code in an arbitrary position in the program. This flexibility is
      required for implementing constructs like <code><span class="kw">try-catch</span></code> and <code><span class="kw">yield</span></code>. Slogan
      exposes the ability to completely control the execution order of instructions as a first-class language entity. This will allow users to build
      control structures that have the same power and expressiveness as the ones that are baked into the language.</p>

    <h3>10.2.1 Continuations</h3>

    <p>During the evaluation of an expression, Slogan needs to keep track of two things - (1) what to evaluate and (2) what to do with the value.
      Consider the evaluation of <code><a href="ref/is_empty.html">is_empty</a>(x)</code> within the expression below.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">if</span> (is_empty(x))
  <span class="sym">'empty</span>
<span class="kw">else</span>
  head(x)
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Slogan has to first evaluate <code>is_empty(x)</code> and, based on the result, evaluate either <code>'empty</code> or <code>head(x)</code>.
      "What to evaluate?" is <code>is_empty(x)</code> and "what to do with the value?" is to choose between <code>'empty</code> and
      <code>head(x)</code> to evaluate next. The "what to do with the value?" is the <em>continuation</em> of the computation.</p>

    <p>Slogan allows the continuation of any expression to be captured with the function <code><a href="ref/callcc.html">callcc</a></code> (for
      <code>call_with_current_contiunuation</code>). <code>Callcc</code> must be passed a function <code>f</code> of one argument.
      <code>Callcc</code> constructs a concrete representation of the current continuation and passes it to <code>f</code>. The continuation
      itself is represented by a function <code>k</code>. Each time <code>k</code> is applied to a value, it returns the value to the
      continuation of the <code>callcc</code> application. This value becomes, in essence, the value of the application of <code>callcc</code>.</p>

    <p>If <code>f</code> returns without invoking <code>k</code>, the value returned by the function becomes the value of the application
      of <code>callcc</code>.</p>

    <p>Let us consider a few simple examples.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
callcc(<span class="kw">^</span>(k) 5 * 4)
<span class="comment">// 20</span>
callcc(<span class="kw">^</span>(k) 5 * k(4))
<span class="comment">// 4</span>
2 + callcc(<span class="kw">^</span>(k) 5 * k(4))
<span class="comment">// 6</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>In the first example, the continuation is captured and bound to <code>k</code>, which is never used. So the value is simply the product
      of <code>5</code> and <code>4</code>. In the second, the continuation is invoked before the multiplication, so the value is the
      value passed to the continuation, <code>4</code>. In the third, the continuation includes the addition by <code>2</code>; thus, the value
      is the value passed to the continuation, <code>4</code>, plus <code>2</code>.</p>

    <p>Here is a less trivial example, showing the use of <code>callcc</code> to provide a nonlocal exit from a recursion.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> product(xs)
  callcc(
    <span class="kw">^</span>(return)
     <span class="kw">letfn</span> loop(xs = xs)
       <span class="kw">if</span> (is_empty(xs)) 1
       <span class="kw">else if</span> (is_zero(head(xs))) return(0)
       <span class="kw">else</span> head(xs) * loop(tail(xs)))

product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
<span class="comment">// 120</span>
product([1,2,3,0,4,5])
<span class="comment">// 0</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The nonlocal exit allows <code>product</code> to return immediately, without performing the pending multiplications,
      when a zero value is detected.</p>

    <p>In the <a href="syntax.html">chapter</a> on designing new languages, we will complete our journey into building new control abstractions.
      There we will implement a whole new sub-language in Slogan that will enable us to write
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_programming" target="_blank">nondeterministic programs</a>.</p>
