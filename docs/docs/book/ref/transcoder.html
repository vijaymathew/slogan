      <pre><code>
transcoder(codec, <span class="pw">@optional</span> eol_style = <span class="sym">'crlf</span>, error_handling_mode = <span class="sym">'ignore</span>)

    </div>

    <p>Return a transcoder encapsulating <code>codec</code>, <code>eol_style</code>, and <code>error_handling_mode</code>.</p>

    <p>In many cases, the underlying <a href="current_reader.html">stream</a> is organized as a sequence of bytes, but these bytes may
      have to be treated as encodings for
      <a href="is_character.html">characters</a>. In this case, a textual stream may be created with a transcoder to decode bytes to
      characters (for input) or encode characters to bytes (for output). A transcoder encapsulates a codec that determine how characters are
      represented as bytes.</p>

    <p><code>Codec</code> must be one of:

      <table width="75%">
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'ISO_8859_1</span></td><td class="desc">ISO-8859-1 character encoding. Each character is encoded by a single byte.
            Only Unicode characters with a code in the range 0 to 255 are allowed.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'ASCII</span></td><td>ASCII character encoding. Each character is encoded by a single byte.
            In principle only Unicode characters with a code in the range 0 to 127 are allowed but most types of streams treat this exactly
            like ISO-8859-1.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'UTF_8</span></td><td>UTF-8 character encoding. Each character is encoded by a sequence of one to four bytes.
            The minimum length UTF-8 encoding is used. If a BOM is needed at the beginning of the stream then it must be explicitly written.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'UTF_16</span></td><td>UTF-16 character encoding. Each character is encoded by one or two 16 bit integers
            (2 or 4 bytes). The 16 bit integers may be encoded using little-endian encoding or big-endian encoding. If the stream is a reader and
            the first two bytes read are a BOM ("Byte Order Mark" character with hexadecimal code <code>FEFF</code>) then the BOM will be discarded
            and the endianness will be set accordingly, otherwise the endianness depends on the operating system and how the Slogan runtime was compiled.
            If the stream is writer then a BOM will be output at the beginning of the stream and the endianness depends on the operating system
            and how the Slogan runtime was compiled.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'UTF_16LE</span></td><td>UTF-16 character encoding with little-endian endianness. It is like UTF-16 except
            the endianness is set to little-endian and there is no BOM processing. If a BOM is needed at the beginning of the stream then it must
            be explicitly written.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'UTF_16BE</span></td><td>UTF-16 character encoding with big-endian endianness. It is like UTF-16LE except the
            endianness is set to big-endian.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'UCS_2</span></td><td>UCS-2 character encoding. Each character is encoded by a 16 bit integer (2 bytes).
          The 16 bit integers may be encoded using little-endian encoding or big-endian encoding. If the stream is reader and the first two bytes
          read are a BOM ("Byte Order Mark" character with hexadecimal code <code>FEFF</code>) then the BOM will be discarded and the endianness
          will be set accordingly, otherwise the endianness depends on the operating system and how the Slogan runtime was compiled. If the
          stream is a writer then a BOM will be output at the beginning of the stream and the endianness depends on the operating system
          and how the Slogan runtime was compiled.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'UCS_2LE</span></td><td>UCS-2 character encoding with little-endian endianness. It is like UCS-2 except the
            endianness is set to little-endian and there is no BOM processing. If a BOM is needed at the beginning of
            the stream then it must be explicitly written.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'UCS_2BE</span></td><td>UCS-2 character encoding with big-endian endianness. It is like UCS-2LE except
            the endianness is set to big-endian.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'UCS_4</span></td><td>UCS-4 character encoding. Each character is encoded by a 32 integer (4 bytes).
            The 32 bit integers may be encoded using little-endian encoding or big-endian encoding. If the stream is a reader and the first four
            bytes read are a BOM ("Byte Order Mark" character with hexadecimal code <code>FEFF</code>) then the BOM will be discarded and
            the endianness will be set accordingly, otherwise the endianness depends on the operating system and how the Slogan runtime was compiled.
            If the stream is a writer then a BOM will be output at the beginning of the stream and the endianness depends on the
            operating system and how the Slogan runtime was compiled.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'UCS_4LE</span></td><td>UCS-4 character encoding with little-endian endianness. It is like UCS-4
            except the endianness is set to little-endian and there is no BOM processing. If a BOM is needed at the beginning of the stream
            then it must be explicitly written.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="sym">'UCS_4BE</span>.</td><td>UCS-4 character encoding with big-endian endianness. It is like UCS-4LE except
            the endianness is set to big-endian.</td></tr>
      </table>

    <p>In addition to the above these codecs are also supported: <code>UTF / UTF-fallback-ASCII / UTF-fallback-ISO-8859-1
        / UTF-fallback-UTF-16 / UTF-fallback-UTF-16LE / UTF-fallback-UTF-16BE</code>. These encodings combine the UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings.
      When one of these character encodings is used for an output port, characters will be encoded using the UTF-8 encoding. The first character,
      if there is one, is prefixed with a UTF-8 BOM (the three byte sequence EF BB BF in hexadecimal). When one of these character encodings is
      used for an input stream, the character encoding depends on the first few bytes. If the first bytes of the stream are a UTF-16LE BOM
      (FF FE in hexadecimal), or a UTF-16BE BOM (FE FF in hexadecimal), or a UTF-8 BOM (EF BB BF in hexadecimal), then the BOM is discarded
      and the remaining bytes of the stream are decoded using the corresponding character encoding. If a BOM is not present, then the stream
      is decoded using the fallback encoding specified. The encoding UTF is a synonym for UTF-fallback-UTF-8. Note that the UTF character encoding
      for input will correctly handle streams produced using the encodings UTF, UTF-8, UTF-16, ASCII, and if an explicit BOM is output,
      the encodings UTF-16LE, and UTF-16BE.</p>


    <p><code>Eol_style</code> determines how line endings are recognized. Supported eol styles are:</p>

    <table>
      <tr><td><span class="sym">'lf</span></td><td class="desc">line-feed character</td></tr>
      <tr><td><span class="sym">'cr</span></td><td>carriage-return character</td></tr>
      <tr><td><span class="sym">'crlf</span></td><td>carriage return followed by line feed</td></tr>
      <tr><td><span class="sym">'none</span></td><td>no line endings are recognized</td><tr>
    </table>

    <p>In addition to the <code>codec</code> and <code>eol_style</code>, a transcoder encapsulates just one other
      piece of information: an error-handling mode that determine what happens if a decoding
      or encoding error occurs, i.e., if a sequence of bytes cannot be converted to a character
      with the encapsulated codec in the input direction or a character cannot be converted to
      a sequence of bytes with the encapsulated codec in the output direction. The error-handling
      mode should be one of <span class="sym">'ignore</span>, <span class="sym">'raise</span> and <span class="sym">'replace</span>.
      If the error-handling mode is <span class="sym">'ignore</span>, the offending sequence of bytes or the
      character is ignored. If the error-handling mode is <span class="sym">'raise</span>, an exception with condition
      type i/o-decoding or i/o-encoding is raised; in the input direction, the stream is positioned
      beyond the sequence of bytes. If the error-handling mode is <span class="sym">'replace</span>, a replacement
      character or character encoding is produced. In the input direction the replacement character
      is <code>U+FFFD</code>, while in the output direction the replacement is either the encoding of
      <code>U+FFFD</code> for unicode codecs or the encoding of the question-mark character (?)
      for other codecs.</p>
