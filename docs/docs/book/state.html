    <h1 class="title">State and Modularity</h1>

    <h2>7.1 The State of the World</h2>
    
    <p>The world around us is populated by independent objects. If an object's behavior
      is influenced by its history, then it is said to have <em>state</em>. For example, a bank account has state if it reports a new balance after
      a successful withdrawal operation. The bank account we defined in the previous chapter do not have state, because the withdrawal operation
      returned a new bank account instead of updating the current balance. This is not how bank accounts in the real world works!</p>

    <p>To create bank account object that behave exactly like its real world counterpart, we need an operation that can change the value
      associated with its local variable. Slogan provides the <em>assignment operator</em> for this purpose. Assignment is accomplished by the
      statement:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
var = new_value
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Using assignment, we will define a new bank account abstraction that support three fundamental operations &ndash; <code>balance</code> for
      checking the current balance, <code>deposit</code> for adding money to the current balance and <code>withdraw</code> for getting money out of
      the account.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> make_bank_account(balance)
  <span class="pw">where</span> balance > 0
{ <span class="kw">function</span> deposit(amount)
    balance = balance + amount

  <span class="kw">function</span> withdraw(amount)
    <span class="pw">where</span> balance - amount > 0
    balance = balance - amount
    
  <span class="kw">^</span>(message)
  | <span class="sym">'balance</span> -> balance
  | <span class="sym">'deposit</span> -> deposit
  | <span class="sym">'withdraw</span> -> withdraw }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>As it can now update its internal state, a single instance of bank account is able to keep track of the running balance over
      a series of transactions:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> account = make_bank_account(100)
account.deposit(10)
account.balance
<span class="comment">// 110</span>
account.withdraw(80)
account.balance
<span class="comment">// 30</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Assignment helps a lot in improving the <em>modularity</em> of a system. To understand this better, consider a function that
      adds the number <code>2</code> to its argument. For the purpose of reporting some metrics, it should also log the number of times
      it was called. Without assignment, this is how we would define and use this function:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> add2(x, n)
{ <a href="ref/showln.html">showln</a>(<span class="str">"add2: "</span>, n+1)
  x+2:n+1 }

<span class="kw">let</span> fn = 0
<span class="kw">let</span> r:fn2 = add2(10, fn)
<span class="comment">//> add2: 1</span>
r
<span class="comment">// 12</span>

<span class="kw">let</span> r:fn3 = add2(21, fn2)
<span class="comment">//> add2: 2</span>
r
<span class="comment">// 23</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The user of <code>add2</code> only cares about the result of calling the function, i.e <code>x</code> added with <code>2</code>.
      But now he has to worry about the implementation details of <code>add2</code> and define extra variables to correctly keep track of the
      metrics. If the caller is careless about the second argument, the metrics log will become wrong and useless.</p>

    <p>The implementation of <code>add2</code> in not <em>modular</em> because it <em>leaks</em> its internals to other parts of the program.
      Assignment allows us to easily fix the problem. We will maintain the count in a changing variable visible only to <code>add2</code>:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> add2 =
  <span class="kw">let</span> (call_count = 0)
    <span class="kw">function</span> (x)
    { call_count = call_count + 1
      showln(<span class="str">"add2: "</span>, call_count)
      x + 2 }

add2(10)
<span class="comment">//> add2: 1</span>
<span class="comment">// 12</span>

add2(21)
<span class="comment">//> add2: 2</span>
<span class="comment">// 23</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    
    <h3>7.1.1 The Costs of Assignment</h3>

    <p>As we saw in the preceding section, assignment helps to model objects in the real world in a modular fashion. But this convenience
      comes with a price. Once we introduce assignment, it becomes harder to reason about the functions we write. As long as we don't do assignments,
      two invocations of the same function with the same arguments will produce the same result. In other words, functions without assignment are
      computing <em>mathematical</em> functions with easily verifiable properties. This style of programming is known
      as <em>functional programming</em>.</p>

    <p>Consider a simple function that decrements a number by a given amount. Let us first write a <em>functional</em> version and
      how see how simple reasoning techniques can be applied to verify its correctness.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> make_dec(balance)
  <span class="kw">^</span>(amount) balance - amount
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Does the function returned by <code>make_dec</code> work as expected? Is it possible to verify its correctness without actually running it?
      For instance, consider the function returned by the call <code>make_dec(100)</code>:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> d = make_dec(100)
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>What will be the result of calling <code>d(20)</code> followed by a call to <code>d(45)</code>?
      It will produce <code>80</code> and <code>55</code>. We can verify this by simply substituting the
      variables <code>balance</code> and <code>amount</code> in the function body with their respective values. We can "expand" the function call
      to the following steps:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
d(20)
=&gt; balance - amount
=&gt; 100 - 20
=&gt; 80

d(45)
=&gt; balance - amount
=&gt; 100 - 45
=&gt; 55
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>We are able to substitute the variable names with their values because the variables are guaranteed not to change. In other words, they are
      said to be <em>referentially transparent</em>.</p>

    <p>Now let us look at a new version of the decrementor function that depend on assignment:</p>
    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> make_dec(balance)
  <span class="kw">^</span>(amount)
  { balance = balance - amount
    balance }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Will the simple reasoning based on value substitution work for this new implementation? Let us find out by manually
      evaluating the same sequence of calls as before:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
d(20)
=&gt; { balance = balance - amount; balance }
=&gt; { balance = 100 - 20; 100 }
=&gt; 100

d(45)
=&gt; { balance = balance - amount; balance }
=&gt; { balance = 100 - 20; 100 }
=&gt; 100
      </code></pre>
    </div>    

    <p><a name="01-back"></a>Our reasoning is obviously wrong<sup><a href="#01">1</a></sup>. If we actually run the code, we will get <code>80</code>
      and <code>35</code> as results. Once assignment is brought in we loose the ability to do such simple reasoning about functions. We can no
      longer assume that a variable is just a name for a value. It now reflects on the underlying computer architecture. The variable has become
      a reference to a location in the computer's memory, which can change. The programming model that makes extensive use of assignment is known
      as <em>imperative programming</em>.</p>

    <p>Assignment also affects the way how two objects are compared for equality. Without assignment two objects that were equal when they were
      created continues to be so for the rest of their lives. This is because their internal state never changes. In fact, a smart compiler can even
      optimize on storage by putting both objects at the same location in memory and doing a fast equality check by just comparing memory addresses.
      But once we add assignment to the language, for any equality check to be reliable, the structure of both objects
      has to be inspected.</p>

    <p>Assignment tends to be an expensive operation in modern multi-core chips with multiple levels of caches. In functional programming
      variables are initialized once and they never changes. This leads to efficient caching of frequently
      accessed values at the hardware level. When a new value is assigned, the cached values has to be flushed and written back to the main memory.
      This might make a computation with assignments costlier than a purely functional one.</p>
    
    <p>Assignment is also more susceptible to bugs because the order of doing assignments is important. The situation becomes more complicated
      once we have multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)" target="_blank">threads of execution</a> in the same program.
      Slogan provide elegant solutions for managing state in concurrent programs. This will be the topic of the next two chapters.</p>

    <h2>7.2 Imperative Loops</h2>

    <p>Earlier in this book, we learned how to do iterations with recursive function calls.
      The named <code><span class="kw">letfn</span></code> construct is a generalization
      on this to enable local iterations. The iterations we did so far were <em>functional</em> because they don't have to change state
      to keep track of the loops boundary conditions. For example, consider the following loop. On each iteration, a new value is created and passed to
      the recursive call to <code>loop</code>. No mutation of existing state is involved.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">letfn</span> loop (i = 0)
  <span class="kw">when</span> (i &lt;= 2)
  { showln(i)
    loop(i + 1) }

<span class="comment">//> 0
    1
    2</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>If you have programmed in an imperative language like C or Java, you must be more familiar with writing this kind of iterations using the
      <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> statements. Though both styles will work for simple loops like the one above,
      some algorithms can be implemented
      efficiently and cleanly only in an imperative style. Slogan provides the <code><span class="kw">for</span></code> looping construct to meet such
      a requirement. The preceding example can be rewritten using <code><span class="kw">for</span></code> as shown below:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">for</span> (i = 0 <span class="pw">to</span> 2)
  showln(i)

<span class="comment">//> 0
    1
    2</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Counting downwards is accomplished by,</p>
    
    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">for</span> (i = 2 <span class="pw">downto</span> 0)
  showln(i)

<span class="comment">//> 2
    1
    0</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>You are allowed to have explicit control over the looping counter and condition:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">for</span> (i = 5; i &lt; 15; i+3)
  showln(i)

<span class="comment">//> 5
   8
   11
   14</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The <code><span class="kw">for</span></code> loop construct is an expression in Slogan. It returns the value of the last expression
      evaluated in its body.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> s = <span class="kw">for</span> (j = 0, i = 5; i &lt; 15; i+3)
{ j = j + i
  j }

s
<span class="comment">// 38</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>You can exit early from the loop by calling the <code><span class="pw">break</span></code> expression. This expression returns
      <code><span class="pw">false</span></code> by default. <code><span class="pw">Break</span></code> can be asked to return another value,
      by calling it like a function and passing the required value as argument.</p>
    
    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">for</span> (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i + 1)
  <span class="kw">when</span> (i == 5) <span class="pw">break</span>
<span class="comment">// false</span>

<span class="kw">for</span> (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i + 1)
  <span class="kw">when</span> (i == 5) <span class="pw">break</span>(i + 1)
<span class="comment">// 6</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The <code><span class="pw">continue</span></code> expression allows control to return to the top of the loop. Just like
      <code><span class="pw">break</span></code>, an optional argument can be passed to <code><span class="pw">continue</span></code>.
      This will become the value of the loop if <code><span class="pw">continue</span></code> happens to be the last expression
      evaluated in its body.</p>

    <div class="pre">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">for</span> (j = 0, i = 0; i &lt; 10; i + 1)
  <span class="kw">if</span> (<a href="ref/remainder.html">remainder</a>(i, 3) == 0) <span class="pw">continue</span>
  <span class="kw">else</span> { j = j + i; j }
<span class="comment">// false</span>

<span class="kw">for</span> (j = 0, i = 0; i &lt; 10; i + 1)
  <span class="kw">if</span> (remainder(i, 3) == 0) <span class="pw">continue</span>(j)
  <span class="kw">else</span> { j = j + i; j }
<span class="comment">// 27</span>

<span class="kw">for</span> (j = 0, i = 0; i &lt; 10; i + 1)
  <span class="kw">if</span> (remainder(i, 2) == 0) <span class="pw">continue</span>
  <span class="kw">else</span> { j = j + i; j }
<span class="comment">// 25</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>If your style of programming demands more imperative control structures like the <code><span class="kw">for</span></code> loop, you can
      add them to the language! We will figure out how to do this and more in the <a href="syntax.html">last chapter</a> of Part I.</p>
    
    <h2>7.3 Variations on a Theme</h2>

    <p>Once we have assignment in our language, we also have mutable data structures. For instance, it is now possible to have functions that change
      the values in the head or tail of a pair:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> p = 10:20
p
<span class="comment">// 10:20</span>

<a href="ref/set_head.html">set_head</a>(p, 100)
<a href="ref/set_tail.html">set_tail</a>(p, <a href="ref/head.html">head</a>(p) * <a href="ref/tail.html">tail</a>(p))
p
<span class="comment">// 100:2000</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Other data structures like lists, arrays and hash tables can also be mutated:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> xs = [10, 20, 30]
xs[1] = xs[0] + xs[2]
xs
<span class="comment">// [10, 40, 30]</span>

<span class="kw">let</span> ys = #[10, 20, 30]
ys[1] = ys[1] * ys[2]
ys
<span class="comment">// #[10, 600, 30]</span>

<span class="kw">let</span> zs = #{<span class="sym">'name</span>:<span class="sym">'alice</span>, <span class="sym">'age</span>:3}
zs[<span class="sym">'age</span>] = 2
zs;
<span class="comment">// #{name: alice, age: 2}</span>

<span class="comment">// for faster updates, use type-specific mutators/accessors
// instead of the generic [] operator.</span>
<a href="ref/list_set.html">list_set</a>(xs, 0, <span class="str">"hello"</span>)
xs
<span class="comment">// [hello, 40, 30]</span>

<a href="ref/array_set.html">array_set</a>(ys, 0, \a)
ys
<span class="comment">// #[\a, 600, 30]</span>

<a href="ref/hashtable_set.html">hashtable_set</a>(zs, <span class="sym">'name</span>, <span class="sym">'bob</span>)
zs
<span class="comment">// #{name: bob, age: 2}</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    
    <h3>7.3.1 An Imperative Queue</h3>

    <p>In this section, we will see how to define new mutable data structures. We will define a <em>queue</em>, a sequence in which items
      are inserted at one end (called the <em>rear</em> of the queue) and deleted from the other end (the <em>front</em>). The queue data
      structure will support the following operations:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
make_queue      &ndash; construct and return an empty queue
front_queue     &ndash; select and return the first item in the queue
insert_queue    &ndash; insert a new item at the rear of the queue
delete_queue    &ndash; remove the first item in the queue
is_empty_queue  &ndash; check if the queue is empty
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>These operations will internally use the following functions to access and modify the pointers to front and rear of the queue. Two lists
      will represent the front and rear parts and they enable constant time lookup and insertion operations.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> front_ptr(queue) <a href="ref/head.html">head</a>(queue)
<span class="kw">function</span> rear_ptr(queue) <a href="ref/tail.html">tail</a>(queue)
<span class="kw">function</span> set_front_ptr(queue, item) <a href="ref/set_head.html">set_head</a>(queue, item)
<span class="kw">function</span> set_rear_ptr(queue, item) <a href="ref/set_tail.html">set_tail</a>(queue, item)
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The queue constructor return a pair of <a href="ref/is_empty.html">empty lists</a>.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> make_queue() []:[]
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>A queue is considered empty if its front part is the empty list.</p>
    
    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> is_empty_queue(q) <a href="ref/is_empty.html">is_empty</a>(front_ptr(q))
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Insertion should check for two conditions. If the queue is empty a list is created with the new item and both the front an rear pointers
      point to this list. If the queue is not empty, the rear pointer is updated to point to this list. Then the rear pointer is "truncated"
      to make sure the next insertion need not traverse all the elements in the queue.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> insert_queue(q, item)
  <span class="kw">let</span> (new_entry = [item])
    <span class="kw">if</span> (is_empty_queue(q))
    { set_front_ptr(q, new_entry)
      set_rear_ptr(q, new_entry) }
    <span class="kw">else</span>
    { set_tail(rear_ptr(q), new_entry)
      set_rear_ptr(q, new_entry) }
        </code><pre>
    </div>

    <p>To select the item at the front of the queue, we return the head of the pair indicated by the front pointer.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> front_queue(q)
  <span class="kw">if</span> (is_empty_queue(q))          
    <a href="ref/error.html">error</a>(<span class="str">"front called on an empty queue"</span>)
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    head(front_ptr(q))    
      </code></pre>
    </div>
    
    <p>To delete the item at the front of the queue, we merely modify the front pointer so that it now points at the second item in the queue.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">function</span> delete_queue(q)          
  <span class="kw">if</span> (is_empty_queue(q))
    <a href="ref/error.html">error</a>(<span class="str">"delete called on an empty queue"</span>)
  <span class="kw">else</span>
    set_front_ptr(q, tail(front_ptr(q)))
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Now it's time to see the queue data structure in action!</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> q = make_queue()
insert_queue(q, 1)
insert_queue(q, 2)
front_queue(q)
<span class="comment">// 1</span>
delete_queue(q)
insert_queue(q, 3)
front_queue(q)
<span class="comment">// 2</span>
delete_queue(q)
front_queue(q)
<span class="comment">// 3</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Each insert and delete operation mutates the internal state of the queue. An advantage of this is that, we are able to do all
      operations in constant time. On the downside, we lose a version of the queue with an insert or delete operation. There is no way to "go back" and see
      the contents of the queue at point past in time. We also cannot easily share this queue across simultaneously executing computations
      (threads or tasks) without adding code for data synchronization. For applications that require these properties, we need a queue that is
      immutable.</p>      
      
    <h3>7.3.2 A Functional Queue</h3>

    <p>In the pure functional model that disallow assignments, the best we can do is to get amortized constant-time insert and delete operations.
      That is, any sequence of <code>n</code> insert and delete operations takes a total time that is proportional to some constant times <code>n</code>.
      Any individual operation might not be constant-time, however.</p>

    <p>The functional queue is also represented as a pair of lists, one for the front and the other for the rear.
      At any instant, the queue content is given by
      <code><a href="ref/append.html">append</a>(front, <a href="ref/reverse.html">reverse</a>(rear))</code>.
      An element is inserted by adding it to the head of <code>rear</code> and deleted by removing it from
      the head of <code>front</code>. To make this representation work, each element in <code>rear</code> has to
      be moved to <code>front</code> sooner or later. This should be done only occasionally, when <code>front</code>
      becomes empty. Then <code>rear</code> is reversed and moved to <code>front</code>. The reverse takes time
      proportional to the length of <code>rear</code>, i.e., to the number of elements it reverses. Each
      element that goes through the queue is passed exactly once from <code>rear</code> to <code>front</code>.
      Allocating the execution time of <code>reverse</code> to each element therefore gives a constant time per element.
      This is why the queue is amortized.</p>

    <p>Having described how our immutable queue works, let us move on to its implementation. The queue constructor needs to accept the
      <code>front</code> and <code>rear</code> lists as optional arguments. This is because each insert and delete operation has to create
      a new queue, instead of mutating the existing one. We will also define a helper function called
      <code>check_queue</code> whose purpose is to reverse and move <code>rear</code> to <code>front</code> if <code>front</code>
      is empty.</p>

    <h2>7.4 Modules and Namespaces</h2>

    <p>The functions that implemented the immutable queue has effectively over-written the imperative queue implementation. Is it possible to
      have both implementations in the same program, while maintaining a single "protocol" for operations on queues? The obvious solution
      is to implement the queues as two <a href="func.html">closures</a>, one imperative and the other
      functional.</p>

    <p>Slogan provide a convenient way to describe closure objects, without having to explicitly define and return a "message-handler" function.
      This is accomplished by the <code><span class="kw">module</span></code> expression. A <code><span class="kw">module</span></code> definition
      has the following syntax:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">module</span> &lt;name&gt; (&lt;export_list&gt;) &lt;definitions&gt;
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The <code>export_list</code> contain the names from <code>definitions</code> that must be visible outside the module. These are essentially
      the "messages" an instance of the module can respond to.</p>

    <p>Let us define the imperative queue as a module:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">module</span> mutable_queue(make, is_empty:is_empty_queue,
                     front, insert, delete)
{ <span class="kw">function</span> front_ptr(queue) head(queue)
  <span class="kw">function</span> rear_ptr(queue) tail(queue)
  <span class="kw">function</span> set_front_ptr(queue, item) set_head(queue, item)
  <span class="kw">function</span> set_rear_ptr(queue, item) set_tail(queue, item)          

  <span class="kw">function</span> make() []:[]

  <span class="kw">function</span> is_empty_queue(q) is_empty(front_ptr(q))

  <span class="kw">function</span> insert(q, item)
    <span class="kw">let</span> (new_entry = [item])
      <span class="kw">if</span> (is_empty_queue(q))
      { set_front_ptr(q, new_entry)
        set_rear_ptr(q, new_entry) }
      <span class="kw">else</span>
      { set_tail(rear_ptr(q), new_entry)
        set_rear_ptr(q, new_entry) }

  <span class="kw">function</span> front(q)
    <span class="kw">if</span> (is_empty_queue(q))          
      error(<span class="str">"front called on an empty queue"</span>)
    <span class="kw">else</span>
      head(front_ptr(q))  

  <span class="kw">function</span> delete(q)          
    <span class="kw">if</span> (is_empty_queue(q))
      error(<span class="str">"delete called on an empty queue"</span>)
    <span class="kw">else</span>
      set_front_ptr(q, tail(front_ptr(q))) }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The functions <code>make</code>, <code>is_empty_queue</code>, <code>front</code>, <code>insert</code>
      and <code>delete</code> are exported and made visible to the consumers of the module. These names constitute the public <em>interface</em>
      of the module. The functions <code>front_ptr</code>, <code>rear_ptr</code>,
      <code>set_front_ptr</code> and <code>set_rear_ptr</code> are used in the implementation of the module and need not be published to
      the outside world.</p>
    
    <p>Note that for all public functions, except for <code>is_empty_queue</code> we have omitted the <code>_queue</code> suffix.
      This is because the module name makes the extra suffix redundant. We retained the suffix for <code>is_empty_queue</code> so that
      it won't conflict with the <code>is_empty</code> built-in function used in its implementation. But note that we export
      <code>is_empty_queue</code> as <code>is_empty</code>. This achieved by the export specification &ndash; <code>is_empty:is_empty_queue</code>.
      The exported name will not conflict with the global <code>is_empty</code> because it is scoped by the module name.</p>

    <p>This is how we would use the new <code>mutable_queue</code> module:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> mq = mutable_queue
<span class="kw">let</span> q = mq.make()
mq.insert(q, 1)
mq.insert(q, 2)
mq.front(q)
<span class="comment">// 1</span>

mq.delete(q)
mq.insert(q, 3)
mq.front(q)
<span class="comment">// 2</span>

mq.delete(q)
mq.front(q)
<span class="comment">// 3</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p><code>Modules</code> are first-class objects in Slogan. They can be assigned to variables, they can be passed as arguments to functions and
      they can be dynamically created and returned from functions. This is why we could assign the shorter alias <code>mq</code> to refer to
      the <code>mutable_queue</code> module.</p>

    <p>We shall put the immutable queue into its own module as well:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">module</span> immutable_queue(make, is_empty:is_empty_queue,
                       front, insert, delete)          
{ <span class="kw">function</span> front_ptr(queue) head(queue)
  <span class="kw">function</span> rear_ptr(queue) tail(queue)

  <span class="kw">function</span> make(f = [], r = []) f:r
          
  <span class="kw">function</span> check(q)
    <span class="kw">if</span> (is_empty(front_ptr(q)))
      make(reverse(rear_ptr(q)))
    <span class="kw">else</span> q

  <span class="kw">function</span> is_empty_queue(q) is_empty(front_ptr(q))
    
  <span class="kw">function</span> front(q)
    <span class="kw">if</span> (is_empty_queue(q))          
      error(<span class="str">"front called on an empty queue"</span>)
    <span class="kw">else</span> head(front_ptr(q))

  <span class="kw">function</span> insert(q, item)
    check(make(front_ptr(q), item:rear_ptr(q)))

  <span class="kw">function</span> delete(q)
    check(make(tail(front_ptr(q)), rear_ptr(q))) }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>This is how we would use the <code>immutable_queue</code> module:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> imq = immutable_queue
<span class="kw">let</span> q = imq.insert(imq.insert(imq.make(), 1), 2)
imq.front(q)
<span class="comment">// 1</span>
imq.front(imq.delete(imq.insert(imq.delete(q), 3)))
<span class="comment">// 3</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Now we have two separate queue modules that share a single protocol. How can we package these two together so that users can choose between
      the mutable and immutable implementations as they wish? One way to do this is to put them into a "super" module as shown below:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">module</span> queue(mutable_queue, immutable_queue)
{ <span class="kw">module</span> mutable_queue(...) { ... }
  <span class="kw">module</span> immutable_queue(...) { ... } }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Another option is to make use of the <code><span class="kw">namespace</span></code> facility:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">namespace</span> queue
{ <span class="kw">module</span> mutable_queue(...) { ... }
  <span class="kw">module</span> immutable_queue(...) { ... } }
      </code></pre>
    </div>    

    <p>All members in a <code><span class="kw">namespace</span></code> are public and are accessible via the <code>::</code> operator.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="kw">let</span> mq = queue::mutable_queue
<span class="kw">let</span> imq = queue::immutable_queue
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The primary purpose of a namespace is to arrange modules and other namespaces into logical groups. Just like modules, namespaces are
      first-class objects in Slogan.</p>
